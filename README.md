## DMXface adapter for ioBroker
This adapter connects the DMXfaceXP controller with ioBroker.
The communication protocoll used is the DMXface ACTIVE SEND protocoll.

## Setup the DMXface
To configure the DMXface controller, you need the 'DMXface Console' downloadable at http://www.dmxface.at<br>
After connecting by USB, you can access and change the controllers setup und network settings as well programm the controller.<br>

### DMXface network settings (Menu: DMXface settings / Network setup)<br>
Here you can configure a valid IP address for the DMXface controller.
To get the DMXface connected to the IO Broker you have as well to setup the socket 6 or 7:
Set it to 'TCP SERVER', 'ACTIVE SEND PROTOCOLL' with a valid PORT (Default = 6000).<br>

### DMXface setup settings (Menu: DMXface settings / Basic setup)<br>
If you want to receive IO Port changes or IR Remote control data, then enable 'LAN SOCKET 6 or 7 sends ACTS messages' and select 
Outport change, Inport change and Infrared receive in the 'Send ACTS message at event' area below.<br>

To receive DMX channel values enable 'LAN SOCKET 6 or 7 sends DMX channel values.<br>
Choose the number of DMXchannels that should be transferred to ioBroker and the intervall within the channels are sent.
Save the changes, done.<br>

## Add adapter to ioBroker
Add the DMXface adapter from github  https://github.com/DMXface/ioBroker.dmxface.git
Create an instance of the adapter.

## Adapter configuration
Adapter configuration:<br>
IP address:  Same as used for the DMXfaceXP controller<br>
Port: Same as configured in the network socket 6 or 7<br>
Last DMX channel used: Number of DMX state objects that will be created when the DMXface adapter ist started.<br>
Additional channel requests:<br>
Here you can list addition ports that should be requested cyclic by ioBroker.<br>
DMXface covers the possibility to process values of DMX channels, AD values of INPORT or BUS ports by a conversion table. 
The request reads the (converted) value of a listed port an forwards it to a state object as floating value.<br>

Request timing if addition channels are listed (ms): This value specifies the timing within the additional channels are requested one by one.<br>

### 1.0.2
